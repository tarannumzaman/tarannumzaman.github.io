2. I have joined UMBC as an Assistant Professor of Information Systems.
3. I am teaching IS 636: Structured System Analysis and Design this semester.
4. Excited to receive my first-ever NSF grant: NSF CRII 2024!
5. Honored to receive the Dean's Excellence Award in Research from the College of Engineering at SUNY Polytechnic Institute!

I am looking for self-motivated and hard-working Ph.D. students in Software Engineering, with experience in Natural Language Processing, Large Language Models, Data Mining, and Program Analysis.

About Me
======

I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor of Information Systems at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC). I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Kentucky in 2022, under the supervision of Dr. Tingting Yu. I also hold an MS and a BSc in Computer Science from the University of Dhaka, completed in 2013 and 2011, respectively.


Research Interest
======
I am interested in techniques that make Software and Information systems more autonomous, efficient, reliable, and user-friendly. In my current research works, I used Data Mining, LLMs, Natural Language Processing, Knowledge Discovery, Information Retrieval, and Program Analysis to make the concurrent software systems autonomous.
