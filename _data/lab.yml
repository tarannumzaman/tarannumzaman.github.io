intro: |
  The Rise Lab focuses on advancing software engineering research through innovative approaches in artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and program analysis. Our mission is to develop cutting-edge techniques that make software systems more autonomous, efficient, reliable, and user-friendly.

  We leverage state-of-the-art technologies including Large Language Models (LLMs), Data Mining, Knowledge Discovery, and Information Retrieval to tackle complex challenges in software development and maintenance.
